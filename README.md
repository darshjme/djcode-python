## Install

Install into an isolated Python environment. Requires git and Python 3.12+ (or an existing uv-managed Python).

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cli.darshj.ai/install.sh | bash
```

The installer keeps previous releases for rollback and downloads no models. Select an existing local model or configure a hosted provider. See [installation and recovery](docs/INSTALLATION-AND-RECOVERY.md).

<details>
<summary><b>Manual install (from source)</b></summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darshjme/djcode
cd djcode
uv sync
uv run python -m djcode
```

**Requires:** Python 3.12+. Inference requires either an existing Ollama/MLX model server or a configured hosted provider account. The installer does not acquire model weights.

## Why

I was paying $200/month for AI coding tools.

Every prompt I typed, every file I opened, every half-baked idea I explored -- all of it shipped to someone else's servers. I was renting access to my own thought process. And the moment I cancelled, it was gone. No local model. No offline fallback. Nothing.

I kept thinking: my MacBook has a GPU. Apple Silicon can run 7B-26B models natively in unified memory. Ollama exists. The models are open-weight and getting better every month. Why am I paying a subscription to run inference on hardware I already own?

So I stopped paying and started building.

DJcode is the result. Not a toy. Not a wrapper. A full-blown multi-agent coding system with 19 specialist profiles, 17 tools, parallel execution, a hacker TUI, smart context compression, and a model registry that tracks 33 LLMs across every major provider. It runs entirely on your machine. Zero cloud dependency for local use. Zero telemetry. Your code never leaves your disk unless you explicitly choose a cloud provider.

It took months of late nights. Debugging agent coordination at 2am. Getting parallel execution right with asyncio. Building a context compression engine that respects the selected model budget and preserves tool-call/result groups. Summarization can lose detail; full sessions remain stored separately. Designing a state machine so every agent has a lifecycle you can watch in real-time on a cyberpunk dashboard.

But now it exists. And it's free. And it runs on a MacBook.

## Features

### 19 Engineering Profiles + 12 Content Agents

Not chatbots. Specialists. Each agent has a strict system prompt, scoped tool access (least-privilege), a mandatory confidence score, and a dharmic name. They run in parallel, pipeline, or wave execution patterns. Four blocking agents (Kavach, Varuna, Mitra, Indra) can halt the entire pipeline on critical findings.

Every specialist gets a **Research Assistant** that pre-fetches codebase context, searches the ContextBus, and builds a structured briefing *before* the agent starts. No wasted tool rounds on reconnaissance.

Agent confidence is model-reported, not a calibrated accuracy score. Critical blocking findings can stop orchestration; operational errors, cancellation, deadlines and exhausted tool budgets report failure rather than completion.

See the [full agent roster below](#agents).

### 17 Built-in Tools

The agents don't just talk. They act.

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `bash` | Execute shell commands with timeout and safety guards |
| `file_read` | Read files with line numbers (like `cat -n`) |
| `file_write` | Create or overwrite files |
| `file_edit` | Surgical string replacement in existing files |
| `grep` | Regex search across your codebase |
| `glob` | Find files by pattern |
| `git` | Git operations with built-in safety rails |
| `web_fetch` | Fetch content from URLs |
| `web_search` | Search the web for documentation, APIs, solutions |
| `task_create` | Create tracked tasks for multi-step work |
| `task_update` | Update task status, notes, completion |
| `task_list` | List and filter active tasks |
| `notebook_read` | Read Jupyter notebook cells and outputs |
| `notebook_edit` | Edit notebook cells programmatically |
| `spawn_agent` | Spawn a specialist agent for a sub-task |
| `agent_status` | Check status of spawned agents |
| `parallel_execute` | Run multiple tool calls concurrently |

The model decides which tools to use, chains them together, and loops until the task is done. Full agentic execution with confirmation prompts before anything destructive.

### 1M Context Window with Smart Compression

DJcode manages context windows up to 1M tokens (Claude Opus, Gemini Pro) with four compression strategies that activate automatically when you're running out of room:

| Strategy | How it works | LLM needed? |
|----------|-------------|:-----------:|
| **TRIM** | Drop oldest messages, keep system + recent N | No |
| **SELECTIVE** | Keep tool call/result messages, drop plain chat | No |
| **SUMMARY** | Replace old messages with LLM-generated summary | Yes |
| **HYBRID** | Summarize old chat, keep all tool interactions verbatim | Yes |

Plus: `tiktoken`-based token counting (with fallback estimation), extractive summarization without any LLM call, and pinned messages that survive all compression.

### 33-Model Registry with Cost Tracking

Every model in the registry carries: context size, tool support, vision support, thinking mode, provider, input/output cost per 1K tokens, and aliases for fuzzy matching. Type `opus` and it finds `claude-opus-4-6`. Type `gpt4o` and it finds `gpt-4o`.

Models from Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta, Qwen, DeepSeek, Mistral, Microsoft, Cohere, xAI, NVIDIA. Local (Ollama/MLX) and cloud. Cost estimation built in: know what a request costs before you send it.

### Parallel Agent Execution

Five execution patterns, all with error isolation and blocking-agent gates:

| Pattern | How it works |
|---------|-------------|
| **SINGLE** | One agent, one task |
| **PARALLEL** | All agents run independently via `asyncio.gather` |
| **PIPELINE** | Sequential chain: output of A feeds into B |
| **WAVE** | Wave 1 runs in parallel, results feed Wave 2, repeat |
| **FULL_ARMY** | Vyasa orchestrates all 19 agents across waves |

If a blocking agent (Kavach, Varuna, Mitra, Indra) flags CRITICAL, remaining agents are cancelled. No code ships past security.

### Hacker TUI

Cyberpunk terminal dashboard built on Textual. Not a gimmick -- it's how you monitor 19 agents running in parallel.

- **MatrixRain** -- animated falling green characters
- **AgentStatusBar** -- all 19 agents with live state indicators (IDLE/ASSIGNED/RESEARCHING/EXECUTING/REVIEWING/DONE/ERROR)
- **HackerHeader** -- military HUD top bar with system telemetry
- **TokenBurnRate** -- real-time ASCII sparkline of token consumption
- **ContextBar** -- context window utilization meter
- **ThreatPanel** -- blocking agent alerts from Kavach, Varuna, Mitra, Indra
- **ArmyView** -- bird's eye grid of all agents, color-coded by tier

### Agent State Machine with Event Streaming

Every agent execution follows a strict lifecycle:

```
IDLE → ASSIGNED → RESEARCHING → EXECUTING → REVIEWING → DONE
                                                    ↘ ERROR
```

Each state transition emits an `AgentEvent` via async callbacks. The TUI, logging, and any custom integration can subscribe. Events: `STATE_CHANGE`, `TOKEN`, `TOOL_CALL`, `TOOL_RESULT`, `RA_BRIEFING`, `QUALITY_SCORE`, `ERROR`, `COMPLETE`.

### ContextBus v2

Thread-safe shared state for multi-agent execution. When agents run in parallel, they share findings through the bus:

- Typed entries (code, plan, review, security_audit, risk_assessment...)
- Priority levels for prompt injection ordering
- Agent attribution and timestamps
- Conflict detection (two agents writing the same key)
- Versioned history (all writes retained)
- Event emission on write (TUI updates live)
- asyncio.Lock for thread-safety under parallel execution

### EventBus for Real-Time Updates

Full orchestrator event system: `OrchestratorStartEvent`, `AgentStartEvent`, `AgentTokenEvent`, `AgentToolCallEvent`, `AgentCompleteEvent`, `BlockingGateEvent`, `SynthesisEvent`, `OrchestratorCompleteEvent`. Every event typed, timestamped, and subscribable via async callbacks.

### 9 Providers

Use whatever you want. Local or cloud. Switch on the fly.

| Provider | Type | Models |
|----------|------|--------|
| **Ollama** | Local | Gemma 4, Qwen 3, DeepSeek R1, Llama 4, Dolphin 3, any Ollama model |
| **MLX** | Local | Apple Silicon native via MLX framework |
| **OpenAI** | Cloud | GPT-4o, o3, o4-mini |
| **Anthropic** | Cloud | Claude Opus 4, Sonnet 4, Haiku 3.5 |
| **NVIDIA NIM** | Cloud | Nemotron Ultra, DeepSeek, Kimik2, GLM |
| **Google AI** | Cloud | Gemini 2.5 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Flash |
| **Groq** | Cloud | Ultra-fast inference |
| **Together AI** | Cloud | Open-weight models at scale |
| **OpenRouter** | Cloud | Unified API, any model |

Local is the default. Cloud is opt-in. Your choice.

### 3-Tier Memory

DJcode remembers. Across sessions. Without a cloud database.

```
Tier 1: Session Memory
       In-process conversation context. Fast. Ephemeral.

Tier 2: Persistent Facts
       Key-value store at ~/.djcode/memory/facts.json
       Survives restarts. You control what's stored.
       /remember, /recall, /forget

Tier 3: Semantic Search
       ChromaDB embeddings stored locally.
       Semantic search requires explicitly supplied embeddings.
       Offline lexical retrieval remains available without any model download.
```

### Smart Prompt Enhancer

You type `fix the login bug`. DJcode sees:

| What it detects | What it injects |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Intent: **debug** | Structured debugging approach instructions |
| Working directory: `~/projects/myapp` | Full cwd path for file resolution |
| Git branch: `feature/auth` | Branch name + dirty/clean status |
| Project type: FastAPI + React | Framework-aware context |

The model gets a richer prompt. You get a better answer. Eight intent modes: debug, build, test, refactor, explain, review, deploy, git.

### Uncensored Mode

```bash
djcode --model dolphin3 --bypass-rlhf
```

For security research, pentesting, CTF challenges, reverse engineering. Uses uncensored models (Dolphin 3) that don't refuse valid technical requests. The `--bypass-rlhf` flag adjusts the system prompt to remove alignment restrictions.

This is a tool for professionals. Use it like one.

## Meet Your Buddy

Every DJcode user gets a dharmic ASCII companion. Deterministically assigned from your username. Six species, each with 3 animation frames, idle fidgets, and contextual speech bubbles.

```
  ┌────────────────────────────────┐

```

The buddy watches what's happening: detects languages, tracks file changes, notices error streaks, celebrates momentum, reacts to fixes, observes tool usage, knows when you're idle.

## Configuration

Config lives at `~/.djcode/config.json`. Created automatically on first run by the onboarding wizard.

```json
{
  "provider": "ollama",
  "model": "gemma4",
  "ollama_url": "http://localhost:11434",
  "temperature": 0.7,
  "max_tokens": 8192,
  "telemetry": false
}
```

Override anything with CLI flags or `/set` in the REPL.

<h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>

- `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` by default
- No product analytics collection. Local session history and estimated activity statistics are stored on disk.
- Automatic GitHub release checks can be disabled with `DJCODE_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.
- All memory stored at `~/.djcode/` on your filesystem
- ChromaDB vectors stored locally, never uploaded
- Cloud providers are opt-in and explicit
- Local model use needs no DJcode account. Hosted providers require their own account and terms.

## How We Stack Up

DJcode focuses on local/provider choice, 19 engineering and 12 content profiles, explicit tool approval, persistent sessions and 17 built-in tools. Evaluate it on your repository and model; no speed, quality or feature-parity advantage over another coding agent has been established.

The repair drew on public engineering patterns from Hermes, Pi and Codex. See [source references and acceptance coverage](docs/RELEASE-VALIDATION.md) for exact commits, licenses, tested paths and remaining limits. Claude Code documentation informed the loop review; its published repository was not treated as permissively licensed engine source.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darshjme/djcode
cd djcode
uv sync

# Run
uv run python -m djcode

# Test
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Lint + format
uv run ruff check src/ && uv run ruff format src/
```

## Optional low-memory inference

DJcode can connect to an existing Colibri server and plan its RAM/VRAM/context budget with `djcode-colibri`. Supported MoE experts can stream from disk through Colibri; this trades memory for storage capacity and latency. Setup is opt-in and downloads no model weights. See the [Colibri integration guide](docs/LOW-MEMORY-COLIBRI.md) for preflight checks and limitations.
